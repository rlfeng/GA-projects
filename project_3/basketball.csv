The other day I decided it was time and started to pressure wash it first, but there was a lot of paint chipping off. 

I figured it probably wasn’t a good idea to just paint over it if the paint is already peeling off now. 

Does anybody know how to remove the paint before painting over the old paint?  It seems like it’s probably just some kind of red cement under the paint.

No, that's an understatement. It's gonna be probably the hardest thing you'll ever do in your basketball career. But with time, perseverance, you will get it down. Took me 3 months with 2 hours a day of meticulous attention to detail and frustration to completely reset my mechanics, and am shooting 34% from 3 this season in my high school team. So here's how you do it (or at least how I did it.) 

First, learn what is wrong with your jumpshot. Your rhythm is off? Pushing it with two hands? elbow out? All of the above? This can easily be done by recording yourself shooting the basketball and seeing what is wrong with your mechanics. Once you've got that down, move onto the next step. 

Second, isolate the bad habit. There are different ways to isolate different bad habits. For me, the biggest issue was my hand placement and my elbow flare. So what I did was I put the basketball up at my set point and literally forced my shooting hand into a split finger hand placement and my elbow in and held it there. Once I made sure it was right, I shot. Did that for a month until it felt comfortable, 2 hours a day. Some other things you can do to isolate bad habits. 

Rhythm - Sit down on a chair with your basketball. Then, sit up, and as you do it, go right into your jumpshot

Hitch - one hand shooting 

thumb flick - one hand shooting 

Third, once you've got the bad habit isolated, form shooting. That's all there is to it. Form shooting, every day, 500 shots a day. But not just form shooting, correct form shooting. On every rep, force yourself to shoot with correct form. After a few months of this, you'll be a shooter.

Thought I’d share my early thoughts. 

I’ve tested four so far: (1) Spalding NBA Game Ball, (2) Wilson Evolution, (3) Wilson EVO NXT, and (4) old faithful, a 12 year old TF-1000. I’ve got more on the way, including (5) The Rock, and (6) maybe a Spalding Precision. 

My special testing method: very scientifically, I held each ball, shot it at the gym, and dribbled around with them. 

Testing conditions: aside from the TF-1000, all balls were brand new. All were inflated to 8 PSI. 

My recommendations based on short term testing:

IF I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT YOU, OTHER THAN YOU ARE IN THE US AND LOOKING FOR A BASKETBALL: No surprise, I would recommend the Evolution. This is by far the most common basketball used for pickup games, many high schools use them for games, and it is easy to find in a sporting goods store. When you see and feel the ball in your hands, it’s easy to see why people love it. It is soft in the hands, looks very nice with the leather composite, maybe the most expensive looking ball (at the cheapest price as well). But...
- This is not my favorite ball. If it weren’t found on basketball courts across the US, I would not recommend it. For me, (a) it’s too soft; feels great when you are handling in the store, doesn’t feel responsive to me when dribbling compared with other balls, (b) out of all the balls I listed, it does the worst with moisture absorption, and (c) it doesn’t have great “feel” for me when shooting. Anecdotally, I’ve had bad experiences with their quality control. My first one did not last three years under very light use. It would deflate within hours. My second one had a gap near the air valve. My third seems fine so far but is new. 

MY PERSONAL FAVORITE, IF I COULD MAKE EVERYONE USE THE SAME BALL: TF-1000. Too bad you can’t find this ball in stores any more (the newer models don’t count, as it’s not the same ball). Even at 12 years old, this ball is great all around. Not too soft, but also not hard like the leather NBA game ball. Handles moisture well enough, very responsive bounce when dribbling, and good enough feel when shooting. This isn’t nostalgia talking, I truly feel like this is the best all around ball on this list. 

MY SECOND CHOICE, IF I COULD MAKE EVERYONE USE THE SAME BALL: still not the Evolution. I much prefer the EVO NXT over the Evolution. A tad bit firmer, which makes it feel much more responsive when dribbling. Decent moisture absorption which actually improves “grip” when wet, reminding me of the Wilson Solution. But...
- doubt this will be seen much in gyms. At $20-$40 more than the Evolution (you can find the Evolution for as low as $40 during some sales), its hard for people to justify the added expense. 
- this ball looks “cheap” compared to the Evolution. It will never be mistaken for leather, and its bright orange coloring doesn’t help. 
- when feeling it at the store, it feels like a spongy/foamy material. 
- it’s not readily available at many sporting goods stores, so many people would have to order it online, sight unseen, to get their hands on it 

WHERE DOES THE NBA GAME BALL RANK? I really like this ball, but admittedly, some of it is because of the novelty factor and also the uniqueness of it. You will rarely see this in gyms given it costs a small fortune ($130) and  most people won’t enjoy the feel of it. It is noticeably firmer, and before it is broken in, it almost feels like a plastic/rubber material. But...
- this thing does great when wet
- once broken in, this ball is a dream. I’ve owned these before, and it can take anywhere from several weeks to several months to break in, but it is worth the process 
- even though this is the hardest ball for me to palm, I feel like it has the best “grip”. This sounds like a contradiction, but it never seems to slip out of my fingers. This also helps me when shooting. 
- I love the bounce of this ball. Feels so true and responsive 
- I’d personally rather people use this ball than the Evolution, but that won’t happen unless you are playing professional basketball players. 

SUMMARY
For most people, the Evolution is the best choice. I personally prefer the EVO NXT, but you won’t be seeing many people use it for pickup games, and it’s very expensive compared to the Evolution. 

If you guys found this helpful, let me know. Also, if you want to see my notes once I test The Rock and Precision, just let me know. 

Any other questions I can answer, Id be happy to help. 

NOTES ON DURABILITY
I can’t quite comment on durability except the following:
- TF-1000 has held up very well over 12 years
- I’ve had good experiences with durability for NBA game balls, but can’t comment on the current model. 
- My Wilson Evolutions have not held up well. 
- EVO NXT - too new for anyone to comment on long term durability. Seems well made, but we shall see. Quality control doesn’t seem to be much of an issue, but it could be because not many people have this ball. The Evolution has a bad reputation for quality control, but part of this could be because it is probably the best selling ball on this list by far, likely outselling all the others combined, so you are bound to hear more stories about lemons. 

About me: I played in high school and college. Have had a chance to play with many former NBA players. I will otherwise keep it pretty vague. I don’t share many personal details.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had recently searched for the “best” basketball. Thought I’d share my early thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve tested four so far: (1) Spalding NBA Game Ball, (2) Wilson Evolution, (3) Wilson EVO NXT, and (4) old faithful, a 12 year old TF-1000. I’ve got more on the way, including (5) The Rock, and (6) maybe a Spalding Precision. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My special testing method: very scientifically, I held each ball, shot it at the gym, and dribbled around with them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing conditions: aside from the TF-1000, all balls were brand new. All were inflated to 8 PSI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My recommendations based on short term testing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IF I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT YOU, OTHER THAN YOU ARE IN THE US AND LOOKING FOR A BASKETBALL: No surprise, I would recommend the Evolution. This is by far the most common basketball used for pickup games, many high schools use them for games, and it is easy to find in a sporting goods store. When you see and feel the ball in your hands, it’s easy to see why people love it. It is soft in the hands, looks very nice with the leather composite, maybe the most expensive looking ball (at the cheapest price as well). But...
- This is not my favorite ball. If it weren’t found on basketball courts across the US, I would not recommend it. For me, (a) it’s too soft; feels great when you are handling in the store, doesn’t feel responsive to me when dribbling compared with other balls, (b) out of all the balls I listed, it does the worst with moisture absorption, and (c) it doesn’t have great “feel” for me when shooting. Anecdotally, I’ve had bad experiences with their quality control. My first one did not last three years under very light use. It would deflate within hours. My second one had a gap near the air valve. My third seems fine so far but is new. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MY PERSONAL FAVORITE, IF I COULD MAKE EVERYONE USE THE SAME BALL: TF-1000. Too bad you can’t find this ball in stores any more (the newer models don’t count, as it’s not the same ball). Even at 12 years old, this ball is great all around. Not too soft, but also not hard like the leather NBA game ball. Handles moisture well enough, very responsive bounce when dribbling, and good enough feel when shooting. This isn’t nostalgia talking, I truly feel like this is the best all around ball on this list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MY SECOND CHOICE, IF I COULD MAKE EVERYONE USE THE SAME BALL: still not the Evolution. I much prefer the EVO NXT over the Evolution. A tad bit firmer, which makes it feel much more responsive when dribbling. Decent moisture absorption which actually improves “grip” when wet, reminding me of the Wilson Solution. But...

I'm trying to build a better basketball body. 

Right now, I'm very strong. But I'm trying to get stronger and also shed off some fat. While also improving power, speed, vert and agility.

I'm moving up to U16's next season, so I need to get stronger.

I've been looking for good basketball workouts, do you recommend this workout?

 There's some things that I won't be able to do though.

So would you recommend that workout for basketball?

My biggest concern is that I'll get too strong too where it affects my shot, and hurt my already lacking speed.

As time went on, I stopped growing and the other kids didn't. I've been 5'6-5'7 since I was 16 or so. I've been playing in this men's league every Sunday, and I feel so useless on the court. I feel like I'm too small to get rebounds, not quick enough to drive and dish, and not fast enough to defend anyone. Plus I don't get the ball much when I'm out there playing. For reference, We've played 3 games so far, I've shot a total of 7 shots. My main game is shooting and it's what I have the most fun with. But what happens is I get the ball, shoot, miss, and barely get the ball the rest of the game. Then when I miss I lose confidence, which in turn makes me not want to play. I've really lost my love of PLAYING basketball these past couple years and this isn't helping. I enjoy watching but playing is just making me depressed.

I feel like I&amp;#39;m too small to get rebounds, not quick enough to drive and dish, and not fast enough to defend anyone. Plus I don&amp;#39;t get the ball much when I&amp;#39;m out there playing. For reference, We&amp;#39;ve played 3 games so far, I&amp;#39;ve shot a total of 7 shots. My main game is shooting and it&amp;#39;s what I have the most fun with. But what happens is I get the ball, shoot, miss, and barely get the ball the rest of the game. Then when I miss I lose confidence, which in turn makes me not want to play. I&amp;#39;ve really lost my love of PLAYING basketball these past couple years and this isn&amp;#39;t helping. I enjoy watching but playing is just making me depressed. My question ultimately is does anyone else ever feel like this? If you do/did, how did/do you fix it?&lt;/p&gt;

For shooting here are a few tips:

1: Before shooting make sure you have a stable base, try jumping up and look at your feet after you land, as this is the position your body feels most balanced, try to shoot with your feet in this position.

2. Find a shooting for you’re comfortable with and stick to it. The most common mistakes new players make is that they try to adjust their jumpshot too often. Sticking with a shot that you can repeat is important because it builds muscle memory and once you’ve built up that muscle memory you’ll be able to pull that jumpshot without thinking.

3. Keep shooting with the form that you’ve found comfortable, this is arguably the most important, because without practise you won’t build up the muscle memory that is crucial when shooting. Try practising close to the hoop then slowly move out. When i was starting out i tried to shoot these reps:

0-5 Feet from the hoop- 10 shots 5-10 Feet from the hoop- 20 shots 10-15 feet from the hoop- 25 shots 15- 20 feet from the hoop- 35 shots 20+ feet from the hoop- 35 shots

You can adjust these to where you want to shoot more, mid-range, three-point etc.

As for driving to the hoop try these steps:

1.	⁠Jog with a basketball in your hand.

This will give you a feel of having the ball in front of you. If you can palm it in your hand that’s even better. Try and extend your arm/s fully then doing this. Start at the three point line, and once you’re comfortable with it run to the hoop palming or holding the ball.

2. Jog while dribbling the ball in front of you.

This with help you build the fundamentals necessary to drive to the hoop. When dribbling the ball, remember to bounce it slightly in front of you so that when your hand reaches it the next time, its not behind you. This is a very common rookie mistake as well because they usually dribble it too close to them, so when the run, they’ve run past the ball and have to pull it back towards them.

3. Run while dribbling the ball in front of you.

This is the most important drill for slashing because it conditions you for running often and helps build ball control for slashing, because if you lose control of the ball it will end up in a turnover, more often than not. You can do this starting at the three point line and running to the hoop and making a layup to get some fundamentals down.

Thats all I can think of now, but these drills/exercises really helped me to develop some important core skills. Let me know of your progress and hope this helps!

&lt;p&gt;You can adjust these to where you want to shoot more, mid-range, three-point etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for driving to the hoop try these steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; ⁠Jog with a basketball in your hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will give you a feel of having the ball in front of you. If you can palm it in your hand that’s even better. Try and extend your arm/s fully then doing this. Start at the three point line, and once you’re comfortable with it run to the hoop palming or holding the ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jog while dribbling the ball in front of you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This with help you build the fundamentals necessary to drive to the hoop. When dribbling the ball, remember to bounce it slightly in front of you so that when your hand reaches it the next time, its not behind you. This is a very common rookie mistake as well because they usually dribble it too close to them, so when the run, they’ve run past the ball and have to pull it back towards them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run while dribbling the ball in front of you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most important drill for slashing because it conditions you for running often and helps build ball control for slashing, because if you lose control of the ball it will end up in a turnover, more often than not. You can do this starting at the three point line and running to the hoop and making a layup to get some fundamentals down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thats all I can think of now, but these drills/exercises really helped me to develop some important core skills. Let me know of your progress and hope this helps!&lt;/p&gt;

For me i find NBA hand is part of the ball funny. that you can use your body to protect the ball but people can hit as hard as they want on the part of the hand in contact with the ball. And most of the rules emphasize about shooter's disadvantage from defensive contacts.

As for FIBA, you can interfere with a shot once the ball touches the rim, that means any friendly bounce can be denied, or a shot that is going to rattle in can be tipped out, a shot that is rolling around the rim can be tipped off even if it's clearly going in. I don't know if they changed this rule though...

For NFHS, the 7th-9th team fouls will award the opponent 1+1 free throws, the team must make the first free throw to get a 2nd try. while a 10th team foul will yield automatic 2 free throws. this allows teams barely trailing to commit intentional fouls just to hope they miss the 1st throw to play catch up and it can be confusing for the rebounders to see if the first throw misses.

FIBA &amp; NFHS: Face guarding. Considered as technical or unsportsmanlike plays. This rule is just weak i don't know if it's to prevent players from accidentally poking opponents eyes or what. But sometimes, you're hands can only reach player's face even if you try your best. This rule is rarely called but never the less, it doesn't make much sense. Players could swipe as hard as they can towards a player and unless it looks like it doesn't involve playing defense, no contact = no foul.

Also is the closely guarded 5 second rule. I mean teams have 24 or 30/35 seconds shot clock, they should be able to use the clock anyway they like and not restricted to 5 seconds holding the ball doing nothing.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can be any official rules.&lt;/p&gt;

They then were allowed to shoot the FTs, even though one ref had blown her whistle to allow the sub. What is the ruling here?

3. Another one, it was dying moments of a game 50-50, I got the offensive board, coming down caught it, landed on one foot slid (my foot got caught a little sending a jolt through my body, but never leaving the ground), as my other foot came down I then released the ball to a teammate. Is this a travel, as it was called that?

4. Another one was I was getting defended tightly in a close game, picked up my dribble. So the player started swiping at the ball, eventually just putting his hands up over my head. So I jumped directly vertical, and as such he realised his hands were above my head, so dragged them down with force, contacting my head, ripped my off hand off the ball, and my shooting are got pushed to the right. This was not called. Was this the right call?

5. Another, I was called for punching the ball. I had actually slapped it, but a very firm slap, in attempting to stop it going out. The rules state that a offensive strike is illegal, not just punching. So would be slapping the ball firmly, sit in that category?

6. If a player started talk to the competition organiser, stating about how the refs had been making horrible calls during the game. Is the ref allowed to call a Technical Foul?

So my school team's trials are coming up soon and I've been wanting to trial. I've technically played for about a year+ but I never really took the game seriously, and I'm laughably bad. I'm 15, 190cm\~ and around 70KG, so I'd probably be looking to play center. The problem is, even with my height I tend to struggle with Putbacks / Rebounds, and my ball handling/shooting is god-awful.

What are some examples of drills to practice for Rebounding / Putbacks, and good post moves to learn?

Went shooting again today, which I try to do at least every couple days or so. I've always had basketball as a means to throw down with friends when there's nothing else going on. 

Basically, uhh, I'm trash. I just went 4 for 46 (I counted, sadly) shooting. I've always been a pretty bad shooter, but I seem to only be getting worse. When I was slightly younger I would just play by passing the ball around and defense, but the issue is that I'm now 5'11 and only 140 pounds. I can't really do that anymore, I just get mowed.

If I want to be able to pose any kind of threat on the court I pretty much have to reign in my abysmal shooting. Mostly airballs, at that. Everyone's always told me that my form looks awful, or I shoot like a WNBA player or whatever, and to find what feels ""natural"".

Problem is, shooting in general just doesn't feel very natural to me. I've tried both hands, swinging my hips different ways, different foot positions, arches, etc. Nothing has improved by even a tiny margin. 

Is there something I'm just not understanding? Am I shooting horribly, horribly, wrong? I definitely feel like my playstyle has nothing to do with scoring at all, but like I said, I can't fall back on being a big guy because I'm not.

It's starting to get really frustrating and embarrassing, honestly. It's really hard to keep going when every ball you put up airballs so bad it looks like I was lob passing to the backboard.

The only time I can even stand a chance is when whoever I'm going against is smaller or the same size as me. I'm toast under any other scenario. It used to be humbling but now it's kind of annoying, lol.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post might goose egg but I figured it&amp;#39;s worth asking, why not.&lt;/p&gt;

I've always had a very poor jump shot my whole life. It was never consistent, and I have a feeling that a lot of it is probably my poor shooting mechanics. I've really looked deep into fixing it and then not actually going out there and practicing, as nowadays it's more of a ""I sometimes wish I could"" thing. Well anyways, I've just shot around today for fun, and I kinda got interested in playing again. I never actually played serious pick-up games or actual league games, only with friends and in basketball fitness in high school (not the basketball team). My jump shot was always an issue. Dribbling and driving are some things I know I could probably be more consistent with more practice, but I'm not so optimistic about shooting.

But yeah, I just couldn't be consistent at all, and I feel like I'm just chucking the ball more often than getting a nice clean shot. One shot feels off from another... even if they do go in. I'd airball a lot if I tried to follow through, or I'd end up just airballing it too far if I try adding some strength and have no follow through.

I'm glad there's YouTube videos and all that now. But it seems to me that I'm gonna have to just put in work, learning with the proper fundamentals and mechanics behind it. I'm still somewhat confused. How is the arm supposed to be on release? Should it be fully extended and as vertical as possible? Does the ball have to be released at the peak or could it be released as you're getting to the peak of your jump?

I feel like a big part of me being very inconsistent is my technique... I've been watching and hearing that you should have your elbows somewhat tucked into your rib as you catch the ball and get into the motion of shooting. I thought about how I was shooting and realized my elbow is somewhat off to the side of my rib, leaving a gap before I square up.

There's just a lot of things to consider, and I'm pretty confused on where to start.

I'll definitely look into more and more videos, but I was just wondering if anyone had a real general guideline that really helped fixed their shooting percentage from like even a shitty 10% to something more than that. I can't even hit shots properly during practice with no one guarding me, it's kinda sad. Really hoping there are some people out there that have dealt with poor shooting for most of their life. I hardly play at all, and it's usually on and off, but looking to play more often... I'd be more confident to play with others and in pick up games if I was better, but I just haven't put the practice in yet. Just bought a new ball, and looking to really practice now.

tl;dr: Very inconsistent and poor jump shot my whole life. Probably due to horrible technique/mechanics, along with just not playing for a very very long time. Was wondering if anyone had some real basic tips that upped their shooting percentage big time. I'm not bullshitting when I say that I'm probably like a 10-20% FG shooter, even in practice. It's something I really need to work on and I don't want to be practicing bad habits more than I already have. I understand it's ultimately gonna take practice.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR AT BOTTOM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But yeah, I just couldn&amp;#39;t be consistent at all, and I feel like I&amp;#39;m just chucking the ball more often than getting a nice clean shot. One shot feels off from another... even if they do go in. I&amp;#39;d airball a lot if I tried to follow through, or I&amp;#39;d end up just airballing it too far if I try adding some strength and have no follow through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m glad there&amp;#39;s YouTube videos and all that now. But it seems to me that I&amp;#39;m gonna have to just put in work, learning with the proper fundamentals and mechanics behind it. I&amp;#39;m still somewhat confused. How is the arm supposed to be on release? Should it be fully extended and as vertical as possible? Does the ball have to be released at the peak or could it be released as you&amp;#39;re getting to the peak of your jump?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like a big part of me being very inconsistent is my technique... I&amp;#39;ve been watching and hearing that you should have your elbows somewhat tucked into your rib as you catch the ball and get into the motion of shooting. I thought about how I was shooting and realized my elbow is somewhat off to the side of my rib, leaving a gap before I square up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s just a lot of things to consider, and I&amp;#39;m pretty confused on where to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll definitely look into more and more videos, but I was just wondering if anyone had a real general guideline that really helped fixed their shooting percentage from like even a shitty 10% to something more than that. I can&amp;#39;t even hit shots properly during practice with no one guarding me, it&amp;#39;s kinda sad. Really hoping there are some people out there that have dealt with poor shooting for most of their life. I hardly play at all, and it&amp;#39;s usually on and off, but looking to play more often... I&amp;#39;d be more confident to play with others and in pick up games if I was better, but I just haven&amp;#39;t put the practice in yet. Just bought a new ball, and looking to really practice now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: Very inconsistent and poor jump shot my whole life. Probably due to horrible technique/mechanics, along with just not playing for a very very long time. Was wondering if anyone had some real basic tips that upped their shooting percentage big time. I&amp;#39;m not bullshitting when I say that I&amp;#39;m probably like a 10-20% FG shooter, even in practice. It&amp;#39;s something I really need to work on and I don&amp;#39;t want to be practicing bad habits more than I already have. I understand it&amp;#39;s ultimately gonna take practice.&lt;/p&gt;

I've always had a very poor jump shot my whole life. It was never consistent, and I have a feeling that a lot of it is probably my poor shooting mechanics. I've really looked deep into fixing it and then not actually going out there and practicing, as nowadays it's more of a ""I sometimes wish I could"" thing. Well anyways, I've just shot around today for fun, and I kinda got interested in playing again. I never actually played serious pick-up games or actual league games, only with friends and in basketball fitness in high school (not the basketball team). My jump shot was always an issue. Dribbling and driving are some things I know I could probably be more consistent with more practice, but I'm not so optimistic about shooting.

But yeah, I just couldn't be consistent at all, and I feel like I'm just chucking the ball more often than getting a nice clean shot. One shot feels off from another... even if they do go in. I'd airball a lot if I tried to follow through, or I'd end up just airballing it too far if I try adding some strength and have no follow through.

I'm glad there's YouTube videos and all that now. But it seems to me that I'm gonna have to just put in work, learning with the proper fundamentals and mechanics behind it. I'm still somewhat confused. How is the arm supposed to be on release? Should it be fully extended and as vertical as possible? Does the ball have to be released at the peak or could it be released as you're getting to the peak of your jump?

I feel like a big part of me being very inconsistent is my technique... I've been watching and hearing that you should have your elbows somewhat tucked into your rib as you catch the ball and get into the motion of shooting. I thought about how I was shooting and realized my elbow is somewhat off to the side of my rib, leaving a gap before I square up.

There's just a lot of things to consider, and I'm pretty confused on where to start.

I'll definitely look into more and more videos, but I was just wondering if anyone had a real general guideline that really helped fixed their shooting percentage from like even a shitty 10% to something more than that. I can't even hit shots properly during practice with no one guarding me, it's kinda sad. Really hoping there are some people out there that have dealt with poor shooting for most of their life. I hardly play at all, and it's usually on and off, but looking to play more often...

As i tried to call the foul he said “its not a foul because my feet were already planted.” I took his word and let it go for the game. Second game comes around and he does it again to where i almost fall on my face. As his feet are planted, he moves his knee towards my rotation so its easier for him to trip me. Is it really a foul or not? If it is a foul, what would you call it? It got really annoying, and its not like he was doing it on accident. He kept on doing it knowing that i would trip each time. I looked online to see if it was a foul or not so i can call him on it next time but i couldn’t find anything. If your a ref or someone who knows the game well, i would appreciate your input.

Im the center so im used to passing or give handoffs so others could score i dont mind. I dont really care about stats as long as i know im playing good or contributing im happy. But this team is just killing my motivation to play basketball at all. Its been getting continously worse. Today was the worst game ever. I dont know how to describe it but it was bad like really bad l. No one passed everytime i got a rebound and passed out and everytime i regretted it. People were literally running down court trying to get past 5 damn defenders. I estimate abour like 7-8 passes the whole game and im not joking. I couldnt even pass because thats how little i got the ball. At the end of the first half i didnt even wanna play at all because what was the point i was gonna get a rebound and pass then id do nothing anymore. Halfway through the 3rd quarter i signal my coach requesting a switch with someone and got it eventually after the ball went out of play. I get on the bench and just tell the coach im not playing anymore this game because whats the reason to even play, theres no fun in it, and no ones even trying to play as a team except me anymore. The thing was we were at like 40-13. I didnt play anymore and just sat on the bench at the end the last 40 seconds my coach called a time out we had ball inbound and he said alright you guys arent gonna even try to score anymore you are all playing way to egotistically and not passing at all. I want you guys to just pass the ball around for the remaining 40 seconds (we dont have a 24sec timer) low and behold. They fucking failed the ball didnt get stolen they were so point hungry they tried to shoot a 3 pointer. What am i supposed to do with this team im probably gonna have to play with them for a long time if i stay at this club because theyre the same age. Its just killing me to even play in team. Going to another club isnt really an option i can just sign out and sign up somewhere else and easy as that a new team but id have to travel like 40-60 mins everytime because there arent any others near me. I also had to do the scoring sheet for a mens team in our club and i was just fascinated that they actually fucking passed and didnt complain every 5 seconds like theyre passing alone was a sight to behold the plays were just great.

1) Strength 2) Technique of Jumping and 3) Elasticity.

“I think anybody can get to a 40-inch vertical with those three.”

“If some dude is already jumping in his sport hundreds of times a week, I can do slow strength work and he’ll find I can jump higher because that’s his weak end of the spectrum (structure and strength).”


For athletic development, the weightroom exists mainly for structural development:

“If you jack up your tibialis, VMOs, hamstrings… your knees are gonna be a lot more protected for basketball.”

“Simply by increasing that muscle tissue (calves, quads, hamstrings, glutes), they’ll have more potential to jump high.”

Going high rep on exercises: “A lot of guys… they’re not actually gonna be able to push their muscle to get stronger because the joint pain is gonna be in the way.”


Knee Pain:

“Weak knees don’t come from weak hips. They come from too strong of hips relative to how strong your knees are.”

“The higher the Seated Good Morning over the Split Squat, the less your knee can handle relative to hip.”

“Anyone who can do 10,000 pain-free jumps with maximal intent, you might be able to get to a 40-inch vertical off that alone.” A lot of guys don’t have the structural development to keep this up. Weightroom is needed.


Developing specific areas:

Hip Flexors. “A lot of guys, from sprinting alone, will develop their hip flexors. But some guys, their hip flexors are too dang weak, they’re never gonna run fast until they jack up their hip flexors.”

VMOs. “Charles Poliquin taught me that VMO is isolated in the very bottom 10 degrees and the very top 10 degrees.”


Other thoughts:

“I think most guys are in this state where they’re never really producing adaptation and they’re never really recovering from their shitty workouts.”

Where are we in the season right now and what should I follow?

Anyway, sorry if you find some inconsistencies in my english because english is not my native language. Thank you :)

Let me introduce to you my situation. Im the player my teammates and my coach rely on. 1 year before this, there was a player on the exact same squad  im in that has been on that team for 3 or 4 years, basically, when you mentioned this club, you would link it with him (kinda like the three stripes and adidas), we'll call him Gus for simplicity. Gus had to leave and chase his basketball dreams in other parts of the world. Me being the next ""best"" player, i had a lot to live up to. I have to be a leader for this squad and honestly i think im doing alright. I've put it in the back of my head that im ok with this and ready take on the challenges in front of me. But recently before every game, i would overthink alot. And i mean ALOT. This would lead me to question my performance and lead me to not playing well. I think i just need one good game where i preform alright to get rid of this problem. I feel like i have jelly legs before the game, in the warmups if i want to get rid of this i have to go super hard, i often feel tired before a game for no reason. I usually tend to activate during the 3rd and the 4th quarter and scoring becomes nonchalant for me.

Am i over thinking this?

Do i need some sort of mental pre game routine?

How do i focus more?

I think my technique is getting better, but I'm generally one of the shorter (5'9), faster players on the court and have a lot of trouble guarding guys who are much stronger or bulkier than me.

I love playing defense and have a ton of admiration for NBA players who are able to guard guys with a clear size advantage over them (Draymond Green and Dennis Rodman both immediately come to mind, but there are many more players who fit this description). The clear commonality between all these guys is that, despite being markedly shorter than many of the power forwards and centers they spend a lot of time guarding, they're a lot stronger than their size would indicate.

So I was wondering what workouts, exactly, you guys might recommend for bulking up in the right areas so that I can guard bigger guys. I think I'm a pretty good defender against the thinner, quicker players, or even sort of average-build ones, but it's annoying when I get switched onto bulkier guys and they can just bully me at the hoop.

Especially in the state of Indiana where Hoosier hysteria resides(d?). I\'m curious on your takes and how it can be fixed.\n\nI\'ll share two popular theories I hear:\n\nI know the most prevailing theories are the elimination of the statewide tournament and moving to class basketball (1A, 2A, 3A, 4A). This took away the Cinderella runs and communities were less inclined to follow their teams/tournament since there are 4 separate tournaments and 4 separate championships. That\'s one popular theory.\n\nThe second theory is TV. Today, anyone can watch any basketball in the world. You can watch NBA, college, euroball, elite high school all at the tips of your fingers. So why would you show up to watch your local high school who may not even be light years as good as what you can see in the comfort of your own home? That\'s another popular theory.\n\nI\'ll share my story a bit and some ways I can see this fixed. I played high school ball in the 2000s, so I played in class ball. However, I do have early memories of the big tournament and remember it being a big ordeal. I feel that over the years, I\'ve watched high school basketball fall out of popularity. Even when I was in high school and in class basketball, we played in front of pretty full gyms. It wasn\'t always a packed house, but it was definitely the thing to do on game nights. When I go to games today, it\'s basically just the parents at these games. Now that might be more a symptom of the South Bend school corporation (which has a slew of issues), but sectionals weren\'t all that better either. The most disappointing part to me is the student sections. In my time playing, we didn\'t always have the entire gym packed but the students always showed up and were loud. That\'s not been the case for games that I\'ve been to recently.\n\nAnd as far as my current fandom goes, I just love basketball. I\'m a Purdue grad so I follow them closely and I\'m a Pacers fan. However, my fandom doesn\'t stop there. I like to keep up with local high schools to follow recruiting and I like to be in tune with who is the hotshot players in the area today. I like watching the rival teams play each other and the storylines for when star players/good teams go up against each other. The makings are all there in high school basketball, but people just aren\'t showing up. One of my good buddies likes high school basketball as well and we meet up for some games, but it seems like there aren\'t very like minded people at these games, which is a shame. We watched a great 14-2 SB Adams team take down a solid 13-7 John Glenn team and the gym probably wasn\'t a quarter full and there were probably 15-20 students at most. In a school with 1,700 enrollment!\n\nNow this is anecdotal on my part and I\'m sure it varies from school to school, so I\'d like to hear your takes as well.\n\nI think some solutions would revolve around a shot clock and social media. There was already a post on this sub about a shot clock being added and I couldn\'t agree more. Even when I was a player, I wanted a shot clock. No player or fan enjoys watching a team play corners to kill the clock. It wasn\'t enjoyable as a player to defend or perform either. Speed the game up, catch up with every other level of basketball, and play the game to play not kill clock.\n\nNow social media. This one becomes a bit more difficult to implement statewide, but I think it\'s a must for high school sports to get back on the map. Kids follow the big events. They follow social media and when something gets highlighted and labeled ""cool"" they\'ll go. The thing is, in this day and age, they can see every event possible on their phones. They have never ending options for things to do and the visibility is there. I think the IHSAA needs to build a very strong social media presence for start, but more importantly I think the school corporations and schools should as well. Promote these games, the players, the matchups, the highlights. It used to be that everyone would pick up the newspaper or watch the nightly news to see the local highlights, but very few people do that anymore and especially kids don\'t do that. Those highlights and information need to be on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Twitch, whatever. Find a way to connect with the kids and get this stuff in front of the community.\n\nI personally don\'t think high school basketball stopped being fun, I think high school basketball feels like it hasn\'t caught up with the times. People look at it as an ""old school"" type of entertainment rather than something actually viable for something to do.

Especially in the state of Indiana where Hoosier hysteria resides(d?). I&amp;#39;m curious on your takes and how it can be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll share two popular theories I hear:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know the most prevailing theories are the elimination of the statewide tournament and moving to class basketball (1A, 2A, 3A, 4A). This took away the Cinderella runs and communities were less inclined to follow their teams/tournament since there are 4 separate tournaments and 4 separate championships. That&amp;#39;s one popular theory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second theory is TV. Today, anyone can watch any basketball in the world. You can watch NBA, college, euroball, elite high school all at the tips of your fingers. So why would you show up to watch your local high school who may not even be light years as good as what you can see in the comfort of your own home? That&amp;#39;s another popular theory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll share my story a bit and some ways I can see this fixed. I played high school ball in the 2000s, so I played in class ball. However, I do have early memories of the big tournament and remember it being a big ordeal. I feel that over the years, I&amp;#39;ve watched high school basketball fall out of popularity. Even when I was in high school and in class basketball, we played in front of pretty full gyms. It wasn&amp;#39;t always a packed house, but it was definitely the thing to do on game nights. When I go to games today, it&amp;#39;s basically just the parents at these games. Now that might be more a symptom of the South Bend school corporation (which has a slew of issues), but sectionals weren&amp;#39;t all that better either. The most disappointing part to me is the student sections. In my time playing, we didn&amp;#39;t always have the entire gym packed but the students always showed up and were loud. That&amp;#39;s not been the case for games that I&amp;#39;ve been to recently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And as far as my current fandom goes, I just love basketball. I&amp;#39;m a Purdue grad so I follow them closely and I&amp;#39;m a Pacers fan. However, my fandom doesn&amp;#39;t stop there. I like to keep up with local high schools to follow recruiting and I like to be in tune with who is the hotshot players in the area today. I like watching the rival teams play each other and the storylines for when star players/good teams go up against each other. The makings are all there in high school basketball, but people just aren&amp;#39;t showing up. One of my good buddies likes high school basketball as well and we meet up for some games, but it seems like there aren&amp;#39;t very like minded people at these games, which is a shame. We watched a great 14-2 SB Adams team take down a solid 13-7 John Glenn team and the gym probably wasn&amp;#39;t a quarter full and there were probably 15-20 students at most. In a school with 1,700 enrollment!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now this is anecdotal on my part and I&amp;#39;m sure it varies from school to school, so I&amp;#39;d like to hear your takes as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think some solutions would revolve around a shot clock and social media. There was already a post on this sub about a shot clock being added and I couldn&amp;#39;t agree more. Even when I was a player, I wanted a shot clock. No player or fan enjoys watching a team play corners to kill the clock. It wasn&amp;#39;t enjoyable as a player to defend or perform either. Speed the game up, catch up with every other level of basketball, and play the game to play not kill clock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now social media. This one becomes a bit more difficult to implement statewide, but I think it&amp;#39;s a must for high school sports to get back on the map. Kids follow the big events. They follow social media and when something gets highlighted and labeled &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; they&amp;#39;ll go. The thing is, in this day and age, they can see every event possible on their phones. They have never ending options for things to do and the visibility is there. I think the IHSAA needs to build a very strong social media presence for start, but more importantly I think the school corporations and schools should as well. Promote these games, the players, the matchups, the highlights. It used to be that everyone would pick up the newspaper or watch the nightly news to see the local highlights, but very few people do that anymore and especially kids don&amp;#39;t do that. Those highlights and information need to be on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Twitch, whatever. Find a way to connect with the kids and get this stuff in front of the community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I personally don&amp;#39;t think high school basketball stopped being fun, I think high school basketball feels like it hasn&amp;#39;t caught up with the times. People look at it as an &amp;quot;old school&amp;quot; type of entertainment rather than something actually viable for something to do. But it just needs to be engrained back in the minds of people as something to go do and enjoy as a community. And I think this sub is part of that, it has resparked my love for high school ball and I think it can do that for lost of people. But this is just one way to reach out, we need this all over the state.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know this doesn&amp;#39;t solve everything, but what&amp;#39;s your take?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': 'top', 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2cyf7w', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'f0bq3k', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'ldclark92', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 32, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': None, 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/indianahsbball/comments/f0bq3k/why_high_school_basketball_has_lost_popularity/', 'parent_whitelist_status': None, 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/indianahsbball/comments/f0bq3k/why_high_school_basketball_has_lost_popularity/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 164, 'created_utc': 1581088185.0, 'num_crossposts': 1, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}]",,,self.indianahsbball,0,False,0,{},False,False,f0h57x,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,,#dadada,,[],b33e9984-a0c3-11e9-b06f-0e4956f9169a,DISCUSSION,dark,text,False,,{},False,,,,[],t3_f0h57x,True,2,0,,False,all_ads,/r/Basketball/comments/f0h57x/discussion_on_high_school_basketballs_decreasing/,False,,,6,False,,,,,False,2,,{},,,True,False,False,Basketball,t5_2qhsv,r/Basketball,51283,public,,default,,,Discussion on high school basketball’s decreasing popularity,0,2,/r/indianahsbball/comments/f0bq3k/why_high_school_basketball_has_lost_popularity/,[],,False,all_ads,6

Also I need to buy a new pair of shoes so anything I should consider? Thank you to anyone that can help&lt;/p&gt;

So I was playing horse with three buds of mine that I've known for a long time. Bud #1 and I have played horse just the two of us but this divisive issue never came up when it was only two players. Here's why:

So we're shooting around trying to call shots but we're all like Philip Seymour Hoffman in *Along Came Polly*. Not making anything. ""RAIN Drop!"" Then I make a jumpshot from corner of the key. Bud #1 makes it. Bud #2 misses it. So Bud #3 goes for a 3-pointer in the corner for his shot. Bud #1 says what are you doing? #3 says #2 missed it so I get to take a fresh shot. Bud #1 says no way friend. You gotta make that. Everyone but Bud #1 is 100% confused and now everyone is calling everyone friend, pal, or buddy. We stopped dribbling and needed to solve this before anyone took another shot. We tried to reason with him but he said that's how he has always played and how anyone he ever knew has played it. 

He refused to accept terms of a truce. No compromise. No quarter. We couldn't come to an agreement. An unstoppable force met an immovable object. The rest of the game was chaos. The three of us never understood who's turn it was to make what shot so continually guessed and continually pissed him off without trying to. It was the longest game of horse in my life. Next time we're just going to try using BASEketball rules or somehow introduce backgammon game pieces just to mess with him. ""Ok if you make this but roll an even number, Bud #3 gets to pick a new shot AND kick you in the nuts.""

So help me out here. Am I and the other guys insane? Or is Bud #1 playing to the beat of his own drum? Does the shot end as soon as someone misses it or does every person have to repeat the shot? How did you play? Thanks.

To make it  simple, this is how I view the two; Lebron is more genetically gifted and   physically superior while KD is a more skilled and talented basketball   player. The only thing I believe Lebron does significantly better than KD is   pass the basketball, not that KD is bad at it, he’s just not on LeBron’s  level in that regard. Now I’m not arguing who is more accomplished because   that is a completely different argument, which is contingent on external   factors like organization, coaching, and teammates. For example let’s take a   6 ft average build KD and a 6 ft average build Lebron, both the exact same   body, height, athleticism and measurements. Who is better? To me its undebatable.   Now I know it’s tough because Lebrons athleticism is what he has and makes   him great, but does that make him a better basketball player? Take a player   who is the fastand can only drive, nothing else but his drive is unstoppable   and can drop 50 on you with that one trade. Is he better than someone who   could drop 50 on you with more versatility and play equal defense? Just a   thought, let me know where I went wrong if I did go wrong.

The reality is almost every shot you take should be a 2 pointer with fast breaks essentially the only exception. Imagine if the NBA 3 pointer was a 4 pointer!!

A personal example was a recent game I played. The guy I was guarding was significantly better than me yet I strove to focus on stopping him from shooting the 2. I essentially gave him a free lane and he went 5/8 with no 2 point attempts (63% - This would rank #2 in the NBA in 2019!). Meanwhile, I went a measly 2/7 with all of my shots being 2 pointers.(college range) 

Points Generated Per Possession

Him - .63
Me   - .57

As you can see, he squeaked by doing better than me that game... that's with him shooting at a phenomenal rate and me at a poor rate.

33, 5, 20, 9, &amp; 33. These jerseys represented what side I took, as my closet was painted green.

I absolutely hated you. I was supposed to hate you, because that’s how sports work, isn’t it? You wore the yellow jersey with the purple trim that I read as enemy, conditioned by the way its been since the early 60s.

I stood against any Laker, or Kobe fans, as they stood against me --  yet I was still the one who would go watch his latest game winner, or be amazed at another 50, 60-point game he put up, as it became a regular feat.

I was the one being called in to eat dinner, but being too busy shooting in my own driveway for hours, trying to emulate Kobe’s fadeaway jumper, and pretending to score 81-points on the Raptors, or 62 in three quarter against Dallas, until it was too dark to even see the ball.

Definitely always thinking it to myself, but I wasn’t allowed to yell “Kobe!” as I knew the players I idolized, idolized him.

The light sheds on a new day, and still all we can do is reflect; reflect on all the lessons we can take from this gut-wrenching tragedy. 

Watching Kobe throughout my childhood, and then as an adult, a lot can be learned -- and it has nothing to do with beating a defender one-on-one with the game on the line.

This goes beyond how the game is played: beyond the black lines of the court. It’s bigger than basketball.

2008 Finals, you lost by almost 40 points. 

I celebrated as I was alive for my first championship as a Celtics fan, and I celebrated that I could the moment the great Kobe Bean Bryant lost. “I knew he couldn’t do it without Shaq,” I told myself.

This was supposed to break you. You don’t lose the biggest game of your life and come back from that. But there you were, smirking in the post-game interview as if you already planned your next chess move -- as if this was all part of your plan. 

How can one man have every limb bandaged and iced up on the bench, and then find the fight to go on and play the rest of the game?

How can anyone miss almost 14,000 shots in a professional career, more than anyone else who has played it, and still be damn sure that the next one is going in? 

Everyone remembers where they were when Kobe played his last game. 

I invited my best friend over, we were probably going to watch some of the game but certainly not all. This wasn’t Kobe anymore, he was a shadow of himself, plagued by injury and forced to play with kids half his age.

Father-time loves sports, because when it comes to sports, he’s undefeated.

Not that night.

I must have had my phone camera out for over an hour, wanting to get one of his last baskets on tape, but I was too amazed, too shocked at what was transpiring.

Legends don’t go out this way, they’re supposed to go out when they have no more fight left in them.

60 points later, Kobe defied the odds. 

Kobe was different, he was an outlier.

Kobe wasn’t the standard.

No, that day Kobe proved he was immortal, simply playing the game he loved.

It shouldn’t be this hard.

We didn’t know him personally, we’ve only hoped we’ve gotten to see the real him through the highlight tape.

But at the end of the day we all have to live life like the scrawny 18-year old kid who told everyone “\[He\] wasn’t backing down from anyone”.

When life doesn’t go exactly your way, you can learn to shoot with your left hand.

When your competition is waking up early at 5 am to put their work in, you should already be in a sweat because you woke up that much earlier.

When you’re in a room full of the greatest competitors in your field, they see you as if you have an inexplicable aura around you.

Kobe was the definition of mastering your craft: of obsessing with greatness.

2010 Finals, in the game seven post-game interview, I can still hear Ron Artest screaming in my ears “Kobe passed me the ball,” as he referenced the shot that cost me seeing the Celtics win another championship.

Kobe never passed the ball, we used to all joke.

As we learned yesterday, he passed on more than that.

Passing on, not a blueprint or a map on greatness -- but how and what we should strive for in order to be our best selves.

How to appreciate what we have, in the time we are given.

They say you don’t appreciate something until it’s gone, and many of us learned that the hard way.

You broke the hearts of millions of fans around the world these last 20 plus years, and you broke the hearts of millions more as you left.

But when you played, you always showed us the best version of yourself.

Playing with a broken wrist and countless broken fingers, the least we could do is carry on with broken hearts the only way you showed us how to do it: with mamba mentality.

We’ve been taught that even when life knocks us down, literally, we have the power to knock down 2 free throws and walk off the court on our own two feet.

I wear green, and I wear it proudly, but I will always remember the picture during a pre-draft tryout, where Kobe wore a Celtics tee-shirt and all I could think was what could have been. 

Maybe we could have been on the same side to begin with.

Just like his last game, legends aren’t supposed to go out this way, but Kobe’s legacy extends beyond the game.

I’m supposed to hate you, but I’d be lying if I said there wasn’t a hole in my heart that was trimmed purple and gold.

Hey there!

We are a highschool team that's gonna participate in a tournament held in the next two months. Our problem - we have no coach!

Might sound a bit weird but we live in a country where highschool basketball is not a huge thing so we have to fend for ourselves. Anyway, since we've got no coach, we've got some real problems regarding, you know, coaching. We can't do much more than learn a few plays from the internet and that's pretty much it. And that's the main reason we are looking for help here. I'm gonna describe our 5 starters' abilities and styles of play and it would be awesome if you could give us some general tips and strategies we should use in the tournament, here we go:

PG - I'm going to start with the best player on our team. He's 6'7"", he is strong, athletic and overall a great physical player. He's got an average shot from 3, pretty consistent from mid range and a beast inside. He's our star player and will probably have the ball in his hands most of the time. He usually plays on PF position but we thought he should be the PG in this situation since he is the most comfortable with dribbling the ball and therefore the best in transition.

SG - 6'2"" guy with a decent 3 point shot and that's pretty much it from him. We don't expect him to contribute much except for some open 3pt shots and a few good passes. Not the brightest player on the team but doesn't have any tremendous weaknesses although he is below average on defense and inside game.

SF - 6'1"" and is a great all around player. Not extremely athletic but can hit from anywhere on the field. Good IQ and knows how to effectively use picks. Good with handling the ball and has decent vision.

PF - 6'2"" slasher type of player. Likes to take difficult shots and that's kind of his weakness. Not a great shooter but can get it inside and is quite physical. Average ballhandling and passing.

C - 6'7"" rebounder. He is expected to get 20+ rebounds each game. Dennis Rodman type of player although he can drive to the hoop and has a good inside game. Sets a bunch of picks. Athletic but not a good shooter. Ballhandling is a weakness.

That's about it, I'm a bit short on time but this should give you the general idea. Any tip is welcome, thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might be a bit of a longer read - you have been warned&lt;/p&gt;

We have 2 sides of the court: the ""tryhard"" section and ""everyone else"" section. Used to frequent the ""everyone else"" section because I wanted the ball more but I get bored there. No use in defending guys who can't do anything, and offense is usually the 2 or 3 good players there ballhogging. I airball every shot there, I miss layups, I get a lot of TOs, probably because spacing is trash and most people just camp for boards, and I like to attack but I'm not Lebron or Kobe (RIP) or MJ where I can will myself through like 4 or 5 dudes who are all usually bigger than me. I played on the ""tryhard"" area and even though my shot was off, I was taking good ones, missing long, short, in and out, drew some fouls, had good passes, played good D, and I at least tried to contribute. In the other side, where most people there are people that don't play, I just find it really difficult to find a role for myself there.

I&amp;#39;m not perfect, like everyone else I&amp;#39;m prone to bad shots and turnovers, but I would say I&amp;#39;m a good contribution to any team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have 2 sides of the court: the &amp;quot;tryhard&amp;quot; section and &amp;quot;everyone else&amp;quot; section. Used to frequent the &amp;quot;everyone else&amp;quot; section because I wanted the ball more but I get bored there. No use in defending guys who can&amp;#39;t do anything, and offense is usually the 2 or 3 good players there ballhogging. I airball every shot there, I miss layups, I get a lot of TOs, probably because spacing is trash and most people just camp for boards, and I like to attack but I&amp;#39;m not Lebron or Kobe (RIP) or MJ where I can will myself through like 4 or 5 dudes who are all usually bigger than me. I played on the &amp;quot;tryhard&amp;quot; area and even though my shot was off, I was taking good ones, missing long, short, in and out, drew some fouls, had good passes, played good D, and I at least tried to contribute. In the other side, where most people there are people that don&amp;#39;t play, I just find it really difficult to find a role for myself there. Outside of school I just seem to be a way better player, no matter the setting, just as long as it&amp;#39;s out of school.&lt;/p&gt;

1. Lack of meaning in the regular season
2. Load Management

The regular season has become boring in some regards. Critics have argued that its too long. And that the real prize is in the playoffs. This leads to players like Kawhi Leonard utilizing load management. The GSW didnt utilize load management and 2 of their best players lay injured and out in the end. This seems to create an 82 game season where 16 teams pretty much know from the beginning the odds of their team going to the playoffs. Sure they have to win, but they're pros. There's 30 teams.  There seems to be at least 4 teams every year racing to the bottom. That's 26 teams. 4 teams will be growing and not winning. 22 teams. 16 teams get in. The odds of not getting into the playoffs actually seem harder. 

I dont think shrinking the size of the teams getting into the playoffs from 16 to say 8 would really effect much. It would add value to get into the playoffs but it wouldn't add value to winning the league. 

Could the simple solution to load management lay in paying players w a per game bonus? 

Would offering the the first pick of the 2nd round be enough incentive for teams to want to win the league title?

The refs never called it but I was very aware that I definitely had a couple defensive 3 second violations. In my head it&amp;#39;s pretty obvious that all I have to do is not be in the restricted area for 3 consecutive seconds but I just don&amp;#39;t know how to move around in order to avoid that. Can anyone explain what I&amp;#39;m supposed to do that way when I play with refs that are watching out for that stuff I won&amp;#39;t get called for it?&lt;/p&gt;

22 points

100% FT (5/5)

4/9 3PT

2 dunks

I’ve only dunked a coupe times in practices and never in game, and these were my first two in game! The guy guarding me on the first one was so much bigger than me (6’9 and the tallest guy in our conference) and I don’t know how he didn’t block it. I got a pass and went down the lane and went up for it because it felt right and it went in! It was so cool. This is also the most 3 pointers I have made in a game. I even got 2 in a row! This game was so good and I’m so excited about how it went that I just had to post about it here. I worked really hard for my spot on varsity and was fortunate enough to be the starting PF and I’m really proud to see my hard work and dedication over the past years has paid off. All of those hours in the driveway and in the gym practicing my free throws and 3 point shots really paid off. We won the game by 1 point, so if I missed a free throw, we would’ve tied. That was the best part of the night was watching the 5th one go in because it went a bit too far back, hit the backboard, then went in. It was so stressful to watch and those couple seconds felt like whole minutes.

Right as I got to the apex of my description the obnoxiously loud music stopped playing, as I was saying “the players are colored.”  I was trying to say that the players looked like they were in color and the court was in black and white. Quite the weird visual I might add. All that was heard was me yelling, “the players are colored.” I’m in the south. Not a nice thing to say anywhere, but especially tone deaf here. The table of very lovely black people behind me glared so hard at me. Tried to explain for a second what I meant but realized I was too nervous and words are hard. Said, “I didn’t mean colored people, just that the players are colored. Like in color.” But I could feel myself digging a hole. I have now ended up getting more words out and no one thinks I’m a horrible racist. But dammit if loud songs don’t love ending at the worst time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR I said “colored players” but meant the NBA players were in color, while the court looked like it was in old school black &amp;amp;white&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'link_flair_template_id': '3f671638-fe53-11e4-9139-0e96a3f5c15d', 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2to41', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '#2b87f3', 'id': 'et78re', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'SamboNashville', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 10, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'no_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/tifu/comments/et78re/tifu_by_saying_colored_players_while_watching_an/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'no_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/et78re/tifu_by_saying_colored_players_while_watching_an/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 15276141, 'created_utc': 1579851851.0, 'num_crossposts': 1, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}]",,,self.tifu,0,False,0,{},False,False,et7d6i,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,,,,[],,,dark,text,False,,{},False,,,,[],t3_et7d6i,True,0,0,,False,all_ads,/r/Basketball/comments/et7d6i/tifu_by_saying_colored_players_while_watching_an/,False,,,6,False,,,,,False,4,,{},,,True,False,False,Basketball,t5_2qhsv,r/Basketball,51283,public,,default,,,TIFU by saying “colored players” while watching an NBA game,0,4,/r/tifu/comments/et78re/tifu_by_saying_colored_players_while_watching_an/,[],,False,all_ads,6

Have a bad coach that doesn't want to play you? Become so good he looks like an idiot if you aren't on the floor. Being played at the wrong position and not being used properly? It can happen, but constantly worrying about it will hurt your play. You have one position when you're on the floor, basketball player. So go make some basketball plays and help your team win. Nervous about a big try-out coming up? Train harder than you think is possible and do the best you can when the try-out comes. If you get cut, you get cut. Your basketball career is not over unless you let it be. Remember, every pro I have played with has been through the same thing, let these things fuel you and work your way through them.

Have a bad coach that doesn&amp;#39;t want to play you? Become so good he looks like an idiot if you aren&amp;#39;t on the floor. Being played at the wrong position and not being used properly? It can happen, but constantly worrying about it will hurt your play. You have one position when you&amp;#39;re on the floor, basketball player. So go make some basketball plays and help your team win. Nervous about a big try-out coming up? Train harder than you think is possible and do the best you can when the try-out comes. If you get cut, you get cut. Your basketball career is not over unless you let it be. Remember, every pro I have played with has been through the same thing, let these things fuel you and work your way through them. Hopefully this helps some of you.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm 13 years old and, despite my height and build, utter garbage at basketball.

At Christmas I managed to get a basketball and a hoop which I use to practice every single day in the afternoon/when i get back from school, and I've started to notice my skills decline significantly.

For starters, my jumping power is horrible, and my reach is terrible making it so that even if I try extremely hard I can't even touch the rim or block a shot/pass, and my standing jump is no better. I've even taken a fitness course in an attempt to build up my leg muscles but no improvements have been achieved.
It really depresses me seeing 5'10''s dunk effortlessly.

I'm diagnosed with both Dyspraxia and ASD (Autism) which makes hand-eye coordination extrmely tricky and thus the ball slips out of my hand easily when dribbling or shooting, which brings me onto my next point.

My shooting form is also utter garbage, I look up turotials and everything but I only make about a third of my free throw shots and 5% 3-pointers, the rest missing the hoop by miles. This alongside my dypraxia makes the form extrmely hard to replicate and the ball tends to slip out my hands anyway.

I also managed to attend my school's basketball club but only for a couple sessions because the head of PE decided to replace it with another club most likely to prevent me from practicing. Not that it really matters because for some reason the hoops in my school gym are 12 feet high.

I've almost lost all hope, basketball means so much to me and I love the game, but I just have no idea what to do.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will probably get no views or get deleted but here I go.&lt;/p&gt;

Rebounding: I would say it's mostly the hustle, since I've been playing with a lot of heart and aggression recently. I'm a guard grabbing boards over dudes twice my size, I can establish good boxout position. 







Strength: I'm a bit weak, but I've doubled my lifts since I started lifting in November:





Squat: 20 lbs per side to 35-40 lbs mix per side





Bench press: no weight to 5-10 lbs mix





Deadlift: 25 lbs to 40 lbs






Barbell row: nothing to 10 lbs mix








Dumbbell row: 15 lbs to 25-30 lbs mix






I used to be a weak ballhandler, while I'm not satisfied (my dream is to be kyrie lol), but now I can confidently hold myself 1 on 1.








Slashing: my main strength offensively is drawing fouls, so obviously improved in that regard. I have a lot of moves, and although I haven't fully mastered knowing when to use them, when the opportunity rises, I deliver. I can finish with both hands (except on one court where the backboard feels weird so I'm not consistent with my left hand there), off any foot.







Shooting: definitely haven't seen the progress I wanted, but when I get hot, it feels amazing.

But the thing is, since I don't live in the States, and I'm gonna be switching hotels constantly, I don't think I'll be able to buy tickets beforehand online, since I can't get the physical tickets delivered anywhere.

1. Can I buy a ticket at the stadium on the day of the event?

2. Will there be any tickets available when it comes to that particular game? Like, is it so popular that the tickets are gonna be sold out by the the time I get to the stadium?

We play each team once to determine the seeding for the pplayoffs. Winner takes all, but it's not insanely competitive and mostly just highschool kids looking for a good time, even playing pickup games in between. I did pretty alright: our team is top seeded, currently undefeated in the regular season. I did get to play some pickup games in between, while waiting for other games to go on, but things I have noticed I need to work on:






-when I get a board, I have trouble passing out of it to clear even tho I can easily dribble out of it. But obviously I want to hit the open guy, get good shots, that type of shit and I try but usually results in a turnover. 








-the backboard is fuckin weird. I'm a slasher, and I know I can make layups on any side with either hand and I got thousands of moves. But I missed way more layups than I thought, luckily not really in the tourney games but in the games in between, I missed a lot of easy layups, mostly lefties. Do I just need to play here more? And I notice it's weird cause a lot of people miss layups too. I don't even know what it's made of, but it's too rough to be wood, lacks the perfect mix of hard and soft of glass, and isn't metal, where as long as you have a little bit of touch, it goes in. 





-how can I make more spot up and off the catch shots, besides practice cause obviously I'm planning to do that? I've been doing good with stepbacks, every shot I made today, besides one pullup 3 and a spin shot, was a stepback. I'm good at gathering momentum to power my shot, as I also make spin shots (spin move into jumpshot, I usually do it just to dick around) and some pullups, but I have no power off the catch. My last post shows my jumpshot, if anyone wondering.








-how to deal with stronger opponents? We have a 6'3 brute here, and most of us are in the 5'6-5'10 range. The guy has a strong build, although he lacks coordination, and isn't that good overall (5'7, 112 lbs me was able to box him out one possession). This team takes advantage of his size and strength (think of him as a Boban that misses layups), and although maybe one possession or two I can test my luck (I was able to box him out quiet well to let my teammate get the board), I'll get beat up if I do it all game. 






-how can our team play better? To give a quick profile:





-I'm a small, skinny, but fast crafty guard that can defend the perimeter surprisingly well, okay rebounding, good finish, good passing, good handles. My weaknesses would be my inconsistent shooting, lack of athleticism and strength, my passing after getting a board, and my offball defense is pretty subpar. So far, I've only been scored on (during the tournament games) on a well contested pullup jumpshot and a dude twice my size bullying me. I'd probably be someone like SGA. 





-Our best player is around 5'8-5'9, long arms, well rounded physically (fast, athletic, strong), shuts down defensively, is a deadly shooter, good ballhandler, decent passing and finishing. He can hurt bigger guys using his speed, can bully smaller players with his strength. Think Paul George. 






-We have a volleyball guy, who in all honesty isn't that good but isn't a bad player. His shot selection can get pretty shitty, as he likes to dick around, but he had a Klay thompson moment, dropping 20 (albeit in a blowout) and is a solid enough defender and rebounder.







I'd say our strengths as a team would be our ability to shut down people on the perimeter and ability to make plays off isolation. Weaknesses, sometimes we get tunnel vision when driving, although we move the ball quiet well on the perimeter. Game 1, we got carried by ""Paul George,"" as the only other points were a midrange stepback from me. However, we did play pretty solid defense, preventing their big from posting up, and not giving up easy shots. Game 2 started rough, as we missed open shots and I had some bad turnovers. But we were able to turn it around in the second half: I started with a 6 point run at the rim, almost getting a 20 point lead after, and the only shots they made after were a layup and a pullup J I contested. 







I'd say we are the 2nd best team in the league, as one other team has 2 guys playing for the school team. It's a tough cover: as they have a bigman who can handle and shoot, and an extremely quick, athletic guard with a silky smooth jumpshot, not to mention these guys are constantly working out and pushing themselves to the limit. Other than that, every team has a weakness we can exploit, unless they exploit ours and injure me, but it's not a super serious league so players from other teams can sub in (provided their stats do not count). I obviously wanna have fun, so I'm not sweating too hard, but at the same time, I wanna win and prove myself. Today I feel I proved I was a competent player, with good plays on both ends, but I'm hungry for more.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give some background: it has a $100 prize with 6 teams.

&lt;p&gt;-how can I make more spot up and off the catch shots, besides practice cause obviously I&amp;#39;m planning to do that? I&amp;#39;ve been doing good with stepbacks, every shot I made today, besides one pullup 3 and a spin shot, was a stepback. I&amp;#39;m good at gathering momentum to power my shot, as I also make spin shots (spin move into jumpshot, I usually do it just to dick around) and some pullups, but I have no power off the catch. My last post shows my jumpshot, if anyone wondering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-how to deal with stronger opponents? We have a 6&amp;#39;3 brute here, and most of us are in the 5&amp;#39;6-5&amp;#39;10 range. The guy has a strong build, although he lacks coordination, and isn&amp;#39;t that good overall (5&amp;#39;7, 112 lbs me was able to box him out one possession). This team takes advantage of his size and strength (think of him as a Boban that misses layups), and although maybe one possession or two I can test my luck (I was able to box him out quiet well to let my teammate get the board), I&amp;#39;ll get beat up if I do it all game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-how can our team play better? To give a quick profile:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-I&amp;#39;m a small, skinny, but fast crafty guard that can defend the perimeter surprisingly well, okay rebounding, good finish, good passing, good handles. My weaknesses would be my inconsistent shooting, lack of athleticism and strength, my passing after getting a board, and my offball defense is pretty subpar. So far, I&amp;#39;ve only been scored on (during the tournament games) on a well contested pullup jumpshot and a dude twice my size bullying me. I&amp;#39;d probably be someone like SGA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Our best player is around 5&amp;#39;8-5&amp;#39;9, long arms, well rounded physically (fast, athletic, strong), shuts down defensively, is a deadly shooter, good ballhandler, decent passing and finishing. He can hurt bigger guys using his speed, can bully smaller players with his strength. Think Paul George. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-We have a volleyball guy, who in all honesty isn&amp;#39;t that good but isn&amp;#39;t a bad player. His shot selection can get pretty shitty, as he likes to dick around, but he had a Klay thompson moment, dropping 20 (albeit in a blowout) and is a solid enough defender and rebounder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say our strengths as a team would be our ability to shut down people on the perimeter and ability to make plays off isolation. Weaknesses, sometimes we get tunnel vision when driving, although we move the ball quiet well on the perimeter. Game 1, we got carried by &amp;quot;Paul George,&amp;quot; as the only other points were a midrange stepback from me. However, we did play pretty solid defense, preventing their big from posting up, and not giving up easy shots. Game 2 started rough, as we missed open shots and I had some bad turnovers. But we were able to turn it around in the second half: I started with a 6 point run at the rim, almost getting a 20 point lead after, and the only shots they made after were a layup and a pullup J I contested. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say we are the 2nd best team in the league, as one other team has 2 guys playing for the school team. It&amp;#39;s a tough cover: as they have a bigman who can handle and shoot, and an extremely quick, athletic guard with a silky smooth jumpshot, not to mention these guys are constantly working out and pushing themselves to the limit. Other than that, every team has a weakness we can exploit, unless they exploit ours and injure me, but it&amp;#39;s not a super serious league so players from other teams can sub in (provided their stats do not count). I obviously wanna have fun, so I&amp;#39;m not sweating too hard, but at the same time, I wanna win and prove myself. Today I feel I proved I was a competent player, with good plays on both ends, but I&amp;#39;m hungry for more.&lt;/p&gt;

(A balanced team of the all-time most complimentary versions of great players who would mesh well in any era)
Starters
PG: ‘85 Magic Johnson - The year Magic peaked as a playmaker as opposed to a scorer. Also wasn’t a defensive liability yet
SG: ‘96 Michael Jordan - Even though he was past his athletic peak, this is the version of Jordan who knew his limitations and fully embraced the Secret (see The Book Of Basketball by Bill Simmons for elaboration)
SF: ‘86 Larry Bird - Possibly the best playoffs by any player ever:
26 PTS/9 REB/8 AST/2 STL; 51/41/93 
PF: ‘13 LeBron James - The best iteration of the most physically dominant forward ever. Best season of any player I’ve watched in my lifetime.
C: ‘95 Hakeem Olajuwon - However dominant he was on offense, he was arguably even more destructive on defense.
Bench
6: ‘03 Tim Duncan - brings incredible defense as well as great locker room presence to help manage the egos
7: ‘16 Stephen Curry - Shooting, playmaking, and the ability to make multiple “wow” plays every game
8: ‘04 Kevin Garnett - brings freakish length and athleticism, intensity, and versatility on both ends
9: ‘77 Bill Walton - As we saw from the ‘86 Celtics, he’s willing to sacrifice minutes for the team and contribute when needed
10: ‘92 Scottie Pippen - monster athlete, defensive genius, coexists well with other stars
11: ‘90 Joe Dumars - brings clutch shooting and defense as well as an iron will and winner’s mentality
12: ‘95 Reggie Miller - designated 3PT+FT specialist
Reserve
‘86 Dennis Johnson - 10/10 basketball IQ and teamwork

Fun lineups:

Bullyball (definitely the most fun):

Rules are often argued during basketball games. I came across 7 basketball rules myth and thought they made sense, especially #2,3,5 and 6. I was wondering what others think about these interpretations - If they agree or disagree. Unfortunately, I don't know who originally wrote this - if someone could give me the name, I'll gladly give proper credit.

Anyways, here goes:

There are certain calls made in a basketball game that is accepted as reality when in fact they aren't at all.

The truth is, some of the most common truths about the rules of basketball actually aren't true at all.

1. A defensive player must be stationary to take a charge. Reality: Once a defensive player has obtained a legal guarding position, the defensive player may always move to maintain that guarding position and may even have one or both feet off the floor when contact occurs with the offensive player. The legal guarding position occurs when the defensive player has both feet on the floor and is facing the opponent. This applies to a defensive player who is defending the dribble.

2. A dribble that bounces above the dribbler's head is an illegal dribble violation. Reality: There is no restriction as to how high a player may bounce the ball, provided the ball does not come to rest in the player's hand.

3. ""Reaching in"" is a foul. Reality: Reaching in is not a foul. The term is nowhere to be found in any rulebook. Why? There must be contact to have a foul. The mere act of ""reaching in,"" by itself, is nothing. If contact does occur, it is either a holding foul or a pushing foul.

4. ""Over the back"" is a foul. Reality: Similar to the reaching in myth, there must be contact to have a foul. Coaches holler for over the back fouls when their shorter player has seemingly better inside rebounding position and the ball is snared by a taller opponent from behind. Penalize illegal contact; don't penalize a player for being tall.

5. If it looks funny, it must be traveling. Reality: The traveling rule is one of the most misunderstood in basketball. One of the basic tenets is that a player cannot travel unless that player is holding a live ball. A bobble or fumble is not ""control"" of the ball, therefore, it cannot be a traveling violation. If you immediately identify the pivot foot when a player receives the ball, you're well on your way to judging traveling correctly.

6. After a player has ended a dribble and fumbled the ball, that player may not recover it without violating. Reality: A dribble ends when the dribbler catches the ball with one or both hands or simultaneously touches the ball with both hands. A fumble is the accidental loss of player control when the ball unintentionally drops or slips from a player's grasp. It is always legal to recover a fumble. The rules do not penalize clumsiness.

7. Referees should not make calls that decide the outcome of a game. Reality: Officials do not make calls that decide the outcomes of games. Players commit fouls and violations; officials view those infractions, judge the action and then apply the rules of the game to what they have viewed. The rules then determine the penalty. The officials do not decide the outcome of the game; the players do. If the rule results in the imposition of a penalty that determines the outcome of the game, such is life. Ask yourself this: If you would have called it in the second quarter, why not call it at the end of the game? You are a credit to the game when you are consistent from the opening tip to the final buzzer.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rules are often argued during basketball games.

Any excercices and drills I can do on my own and without any special equipment to work on my biggest disadvantages?&lt;/p&gt;

Let me tell you a bit about myself first. I always did well in school. The best in the class, if not then one of the bests. My parents always pushed me to be a good student, but never excessively. I always thought if I just kept working in school, I could get a job with good money after college, and live the rest of my life with that job. All of that changed one day. My mother always yelled at me whenever I've been playing video games for a long time. One day, I got angry after she told me to go outside and just picked up the basketball and dribbled. While dribbling, I would just think about playing video games again. Then something just clicked in my head. Maybe there is more to life than just working and hoping for the best. Maybe life isn't meant to be the way I thought about it. Then I realized, why don't I do something worthwhile. I'll be apart from the crowd following this life. A life of just ""going with the flow"". I don't know what got into my brain or what happened, but I thought to myself, ""What about the NBA."". OK, yea I know that sounds stupid, this overweight kid who plays video games and does homework all day would be in the NBA? Yea, that's what I thought, and I said **why not**. That following summer I worked hard on my basketball skills. I went to the park 5 times a week just playing basketball alone. Me, myself, and I just air balling a bunch of three's in 90-degree weather. But what was special about me, was that I never gave up after air balling those threes. I don't think I even made a three until 2 weeks into going to the park.  So the days go by and it is October. Basketball tryouts. Let's cut to the chase. I got cut. First day. They didn't see anything in me. All they saw was a short dude who has a good shooting form and nothing else. I don't blame them. Months go by I've joined a Rec league. Now here's my problem. I'm going to high school next year. Every 8th grader has a choice of picking a program they want to go to. For example, the MADE program is for people who want to do engineering. Now, a particular program my whole family wants me to go to is MST. Math, Science, Technology. My teacher told me this was an important decision. Choose wrong and your whole life is ruined if it's too late. I want to be in the NBA. They want me to be a computer engineer. If I follow my heart, they will be disappointed and my mom won't understand my decision to not picking a program at all. I'm lost. Everyone says,"" Do what makes you happy."". But, what if your happiness comes at the cost of your families? My brother wanted to be in the NBA. My mom said to his face, ""Choose something more realistic. You're not going to make it. Be a doctor."". He's going into medical school. He always tells me he always had bad genetics. 5'8 and fully grown. Guys, help me. I don't know what to do. *Follow my dream and let my family down*, or *be like everyone else and never be happy.*

Schedule: Lift in my 3rd period Monday Wednesday Friday, ballhandling at 5pm, if I get home before 5:30, I workout until 6.

This is also the days where I do ""missing workouts,"" like if something came up one day and I couldn't workout. A lot of times I end up working out more/longer than I'm supposed to out of fear that I might not get to workout again. 







I would workout after school since I stay late but the problem is that the gyms are either closed or occupied by whatever team's practicing, and the weight room is usually open but chances are, I already lifted. I don't bring a ball to school, because we're provided with basketballs in 3rd period, and I don't want it to get lost or stolen while the whole world's gonna ask for it. My ball is also really used and slippery, in contrast to the fresh ones everyone seems to have. I can only workout for 45 minutes max, as I get in trouble if I work out for nearly an hour. I live in the rural area of my place, so either no one plays or people that play do it mostly for fun so they don't take me seriously. 





My chance slipped when I wanted to join a 3v3 tournament a friend was hosting, but because I have to help with a bit of home construction and I have a stupid event to go to during the first 2 games, along with the fact that my parents don't want to drop me because it's so far or will be unhappy doing so, I'll probably be a sub at best who can't even play because I can't make it or the team's full and I arrived late.

Oftentimes, I find myself playing the post position (5/center) and I'm boxing out on defense, making room for another teammate to go to the basket without the opposing center playing being in the way, or a potential bucket myself.
More often than not, the opposing team becomes frustrated with the way I box out and eventually tells me that ""arms are not allowed when boxing out"" and ""I can only my back/butt/shoulders"" to box out. Personally, I am not sure if I am indeed committing a foul - or if the opposing team is trying to put a handicap on me. For context, I get this when playing pickup games at the community park or with coworkers.
The way I box out is:

If I'm in front of my opponent (i.e I am between the opponent and the basket), I use my butt/back to constantly push back (sometimes with a decent amount of force) and use one arm in one of the following positions a.) slightly bent or extended but below 90 degrees (player 02 in red's left arm to the blue player to his left).

If I'm behind my opponent (i.e opponent is between me and basket), I usually place one knee between the opponent leg and using my arm like so. (For this one, I'm not placing force on my elbow - more so on my arm itself)

If this is indeed illegal in basketball, I would happily only use my butt/back/chest to box out but the reason I suspect opponent often times say this is because either a.) Perhaps street-ball has different rules than NBA/high-school basketball? (I used this boxout method in high-school games on the school team and no one said anything about it) or b.) I'm usually able to box out really effectively due to my height, weight, and arm-technique and the opposing team could get frustrated with this.
Now, I'm guessing arms extending out 90 degrees, wrapping them around the opponent obviously is a foul - so my question is just how much arm can one use when boxing out? Is it a gray area where it's up to interpretation (hopefully, it's not this), or is there a clear line (e.g arms extending around the player are illegal but rest are okay, etc.) to define this?
(The reason why I'm curious as to exactly what is a foul and what isn't - is because I'm wondering if I am allowed to do ""more"" (utilize different ways of boxing out) than I currently am.)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 6&amp;quot;4&amp;#39; 250 lbs and while that&amp;#39;s certainly not &amp;quot;big/tall&amp;quot; for NBA, I&amp;#39;m usually the tallest/heaviest (or at the very least, amongst one of the) when playing with people in my community.

So im at the local gym today and a 1v1 breaks out. Its me (30m) vs a girl (19f). Im not the tallest guy (about 5'7) but i can hoop a bit as i been playing since my teens. I have never played competitively though, just for fun. She was a college player who seemed to have a decent shot and the fundamentals down pat and also was about 6 feet tall..

Anyway i start off by getting a couple easy drives to the hoop and taking a small lead. She quickly recovers and starts knocking down a bunch of 3s and taking my ass to the rim. Now i must mention that im only goin about 80% of my potential as i did not want to accidentally foul her too hard. She proceeds to knock down jumper after jumper and im slightly amazed that she is doing this to me.

Long story short, she kicks my ass and im not really sure how to feel lol. Im not upset, nor do i feel like less of a man by losing to a girl but i just wanted to post this because i know im not the only one who has lost to a girl before.

Does anyone have any personal experiences of playing a girl 1v1? and if so, how did u guard her? I found that when she was posting me up, her ass was in my crotch and i felt that was maybe too sexual or something..i dont know. Also i think i touched her boob once which made me reluctant to swipe at the ball again. I dont think i ""let her win"" as i was definitely putting in some effort and she hit some big shots so she did earn the win.

Some of these posts are from people outside of the United States, I'll touch on that individually later.

In order to get recruited and to get scholarship at an NCAA D1 school you have to be REALLY –and I mean REALLY—good at basketball. I mean really good. Most people have no clue how good you actually have to be. I’ll use myself as an example. I played prep school basketball, played on a good AAU team, grinded thousands of hours. If there is a “formula” I did it. I can walk into any gym and 95% of the time be the best player there, but in the end, I only walked on D3. Here are some facts for you. Only 1% of high school players go on to play D1 and the average height for a D1 basketball player is 6’3-6’5 depending on the source you use. Looking at the numbers, it’s hard to be a D1 basketball player and if you are short, it becomes even harder.

The other way to get recruited is to have great potential/a high ceiling. This is exclusive to people who are extremely tall and/or athletic or a combination of the two. This is why there are kids who aren’t actually “that good” at the game of basketball but are still getting recruited. Why? Because a D1 coach might be looking 2-3 years down the line when scouting that player. This is where the term “raw” comes into play. If you are short, this does not apply to you. 

Let’s move on. In many of these posts’ commenters have said “go D3 or JUCO and transfer your way in.” 

1. D3 to D1 is rare. It does not happen that often and is not a viable path to a D1 scholarship. And don’t you dare try to bring up Duncan Robinson, the extreme of extreme outliers to justify your case. If you go D3 you get no athletic scholarship, you lose a year of eligibility every year you play and would have to sit a year if you transferred D1. Not all D3 teams/leagues are created equal. Even if you average great numbers, it doesn’t mean jack if you aren’t playing in a good league or have potential.

2. The JUCO route. I’ve seen JUCO get through around so much by people who seem like they have gotten all of their information off of one google search or watching Last Chance U. The guys that go JUCO to high major D1 again, are crazy good and are not usually at JUCO because they were under-recruited, but this is possible. Also, the JUCO schools that have a track record of sending players D1 recruit themselves, so if you are a complete unknown, you aren’t going to get a roster spot on these teams and even if you did, you have to produce and fight to keep your roster spot due to JUCO only being 2-3 years. You can be easily be recruited over at JUCO. JUCO is an option, but not one that most people want to use and should not be an option for somebody who has had no previous recruitment. 

You also need viable tape. In todays recruiting field you are going to need it. Tape is even more important for international players. 

Now, for you international guys posting asking how to get recruited and to play D1. I’m going to be honest; you are fighting an uphill battle. First, international players makeup ~10% of D1 rosters. SO, you are fighting a numbers game. Then, the significant majority of these players have played basketball in the US. To make matters worse, these international players are usually very tall, with an average height of around 6’8. And if you don’t go to a high school in the states, you have to get cleared by the NCAA which can sour your recruitment. Going D1 is tough, and even tougher for an international player.

TLDR; Being recruited is about being really good at basketball or having the potential to become one. If you aren’t good and don’t have potential, you aren’t getting recruited D1. International players have a really hard time going D1, even if they have the talent to.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there has been a good amount of posts recently about how to get recruited and how people want to play D1 basketball.

Which ball is better? I am an avid basketball player despite not being on any official teams or league, but I have played YMCA ball daily for almost 10 years straight. 


I have experience with both the NBA game ball and the Wilson Evolution. The ball I personally use daily and vastly prefer is the NBA game ball but I have used and owned an Evolution as well. Here is my breakdown on both balls:

Note: Both balls should be used strictly indoors. Using either outdoors will ruin them or shorten their lifespan. 

**NBA Official game ball breakdown:**  


**Pros:**  




*Has a true bounce and shoots better than any other ball. A real shooters ball and leaves your fingers perfectly.

*Made with the highest quality materials and will last the longest.

*Is a real leather ball. Not synthetic. Has a very nice smell.

*Grip improves as your hands get sweatier and will never slip out of your hands due to sweat. It absorbs moisture like a champ and in turn gets more grip.

*The weight of the ball is perfect.

*Feels great when fully broken in.

*Has the best sound when swishing or bouncing. The swish noise is very crisp because the sound isn't dulled by any excess padding.

**Cons:**  


  

*Price. It's the most expensive ball on the market, but for good reason.  

*Is very hard, stiff, and slick when brand new. Will feel like a cheap ball until the break in process is further along.

*Takes time to break in. Up to a few weeks or months depending on how often you play.

*Hard to find in brick and mortar stores. Will most likely have to buy one online.

*People in gyms will not want to play with it and argue with you because they are all used to Wilson Evolutions. Some will even refuse to believe it's the actual NBA ball.  



That concludes my breakdown of the NBA Official game ball.  


**Next up: Wilson Evolution.**  



**Pros:**  



*Is the most popular and widely used ball in indoor courts.

*Because it is a heavier ball, it finishes at the rim very well and has a soft bounce off the glass to complete layups.

*Has good grip during Winter when the air is cold and dry and your hands don't sweat as much.

*Price. They run about $60 anywhere you go which is not too bad.

*Easy to find in most stores.

**Cons:**  



*It is a heavy ball. I have a scale that I normally use to weigh packages for shipping. I weighed my NBA ball and my Evolution and the Evolution weighs about 6 ounces more than my NBA game ball at the same air psi. That impacts how quickly you can get certain shots off, at least for me. (girl)

*It gets extremely slippery the sweatier your hands get. My hands sweat a lot. People always rave about the grip but I find these to be the most slippery balls around because they do not absorb moisture like the NBA ball does.

*I'm not a fan of how it feels. It's very soft/squishy and has a lot of padding. Maybe people love this but I feel it makes this ball ""thuddier"" when dribbling.

*I don't like how it shoots. It's more of a layup and rim finishing ball than a shooters ball.

*Has a less accurate bounce than the NBA ball.  



And that concludes my breakdown of both balls. As mentioned earlier, I personally much prefer the NBA game ball but it all comes down to personal preference. I just wish the NBA ball had more presence at gyms and courts but because of price and being harder to find that may be wishful thinking.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has been a heated debate in some circles.

But as someone with almost NO feel for the ball in my early 20s, will I ever be able to develop some flashy handles or is that something that needs to be ingrained since childhood?

Would also appreciate some good dribbling drills that have worked in your experience!

No, that's an understatement. It's gonna be probably the hardest thing you'll ever do in your basketball career. But with time, perseverance, you will get it down. Took me 3 months with 2 hours a day of meticulous attention to detail and frustration to completely reset my mechanics, and am shooting 34% from 3 this season in my high school team. So here's how you do it (or at least how I did it.) 

First, learn what is wrong with your jumpshot. Your rhythm is off? Pushing it with two hands? elbow out? All of the above? This can easily be done by recording yourself shooting the basketball and seeing what is wrong with your mechanics. Once you've got that down, move onto the next step. 

Second, isolate the bad habit. There are different ways to isolate different bad habits. For me, the biggest issue was my hand placement and my elbow flare. So what I did was I put the basketball up at my set point and literally forced my shooting hand into a split finger hand placement and my elbow in and held it there. Once I made sure it was right, I shot. Did that for a month until it felt comfortable, 2 hours a day. Some other things you can do to isolate bad habits. 

Rhythm - Sit down on a chair with your basketball. Then, sit up, and as you do it, go right into your jumpshot

Hitch - one hand shooting 

thumb flick - one hand shooting 

Third, once you've got the bad habit isolated, form shooting. That's all there is to it. Form shooting, every day, 500 shots a day. But not just form shooting, correct form shooting. On every rep, force yourself to shoot with correct form. After a few months of this, you'll be a shooter.

Thought I’d share my early thoughts. 

I’ve tested four so far: (1) Spalding NBA Game Ball, (2) Wilson Evolution, (3) Wilson EVO NXT, and (4) old faithful, a 12 year old TF-1000. I’ve got more on the way, including (5) The Rock, and (6) maybe a Spalding Precision. 

My special testing method: very scientifically, I held each ball, shot it at the gym, and dribbled around with them. 

Testing conditions: aside from the TF-1000, all balls were brand new. All were inflated to 8 PSI. 

My recommendations based on short term testing:

IF I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT YOU, OTHER THAN YOU ARE IN THE US AND LOOKING FOR A BASKETBALL: No surprise, I would recommend the Evolution. This is by far the most common basketball used for pickup games, many high schools use them for games, and it is easy to find in a sporting goods store. When you see and feel the ball in your hands, it’s easy to see why people love it. It is soft in the hands, looks very nice with the leather composite, maybe the most expensive looking ball (at the cheapest price as well). But...
- This is not my favorite ball. If it weren’t found on basketball courts across the US, I would not recommend it. For me, (a) it’s too soft; feels great when you are handling in the store, doesn’t feel responsive to me when dribbling compared with other balls, (b) out of all the balls I listed, it does the worst with moisture absorption, and (c) it doesn’t have great “feel” for me when shooting. Anecdotally, I’ve had bad experiences with their quality control. My first one did not last three years under very light use. It would deflate within hours. My second one had a gap near the air valve. My third seems fine so far but is new. 

MY PERSONAL FAVORITE, IF I COULD MAKE EVERYONE USE THE SAME BALL: TF-1000. Too bad you can’t find this ball in stores any more (the newer models don’t count, as it’s not the same ball). Even at 12 years old, this ball is great all around. Not too soft, but also not hard like the leather NBA game ball. Handles moisture well enough, very responsive bounce when dribbling, and good enough feel when shooting. This isn’t nostalgia talking, I truly feel like this is the best all around ball on this list. 

MY SECOND CHOICE, IF I COULD MAKE EVERYONE USE THE SAME BALL: still not the Evolution. I much prefer the EVO NXT over the Evolution. A tad bit firmer, which makes it feel much more responsive when dribbling. Decent moisture absorption which actually improves “grip” when wet, reminding me of the Wilson Solution. But...
- doubt this will be seen much in gyms. At $20-$40 more than the Evolution (you can find the Evolution for as low as $40 during some sales), its hard for people to justify the added expense. 
- this ball looks “cheap” compared to the Evolution. It will never be mistaken for leather, and its bright orange coloring doesn’t help. 
- when feeling it at the store, it feels like a spongy/foamy material. 
- it’s not readily available at many sporting goods stores, so many people would have to order it online, sight unseen, to get their hands on it 

WHERE DOES THE NBA GAME BALL RANK? I really like this ball, but admittedly, some of it is because of the novelty factor and also the uniqueness of it. You will rarely see this in gyms given it costs a small fortune ($130) and  most people won’t enjoy the feel of it. It is noticeably firmer, and before it is broken in, it almost feels like a plastic/rubber material. But...
- this thing does great when wet
- once broken in, this ball is a dream. I’ve owned these before, and it can take anywhere from several weeks to several months to break in, but it is worth the process 
- even though this is the hardest ball for me to palm, I feel like it has the best “grip”. This sounds like a contradiction, but it never seems to slip out of my fingers. This also helps me when shooting. 
- I love the bounce of this ball. Feels so true and responsive 
- I’d personally rather people use this ball than the Evolution, but that won’t happen unless you are playing professional basketball players. 

SUMMARY
For most people, the Evolution is the best choice. I personally prefer the EVO NXT, but you won’t be seeing many people use it for pickup games, and it’s very expensive compared to the Evolution. 

If you guys found this helpful, let me know. Also, if you want to see my notes once I test The Rock and Precision, just let me know. 

Any other questions I can answer, Id be happy to help. 

NOTES ON DURABILITY
I can’t quite comment on durability except the following:
- TF-1000 has held up very well over 12 years
- I’ve had good experiences with durability for NBA game balls, but can’t comment on the current model. 
- My Wilson Evolutions have not held up well. 
- EVO NXT - too new for anyone to comment on long term durability. Seems well made, but we shall see. Quality control doesn’t seem to be much of an issue, but it could be because not many people have this ball. The Evolution has a bad reputation for quality control, but part of this could be because it is probably the best selling ball on this list by far, likely outselling all the others combined, so you are bound to hear more stories about lemons. 

About me: I played in high school and college. Have had a chance to play with many former NBA players. I will otherwise keep it pretty vague. I don’t share many personal details.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had recently searched for the “best” basketball. Thought I’d share my early thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm trying to build a better basketball body. 

Right now, I'm very strong. But I'm trying to get stronger and also shed off some fat. While also improving power, speed, vert and agility.

I'm moving up to U16's next season, so I need to get stronger.

I've been looking for good basketball workouts, do you recommend this workout?
